 

Okay, I need to create a comprehensive README.md and a CONTRIBUTING.md file based on the user's instructions. Let me start by understanding what each file should contain.

For the README.md, the user specified five sections: Project Title, Description, Installation Instructions, Usage Examples, and License Section. I'll need to make sure each of these is clearly addressed. Since there's no specific code context provided beyond the filenames, I'll have to create general but detailed content for each section.

Starting with the Project Title, it should be a clear and concise name for the project. Maybe something like "ProjectName" but I should think of a more meaningful name.

The Description section should give an overview of what the project does. I'll need to explain the purpose and key features. It should be engaging to attract potential contributors or users.

Installation Instructions should be step-by-step, covering how to set up the project locally. I'll assume it's a Python project, so I'll include commands like cloning the repository, installing dependencies using pip, and any specific setup steps.

For Usage Examples, I'll provide some code snippets or commands showing how to use the project. This helps users understand how to interact with the software.

The License Section needs to specify the type of license the project is under. I'll choose an appropriate one, like MIT, and include a brief description.

Now, moving on to the CONTRIBUTING.md file. The user wants a License section and Guidelines for contributing. The license here should match the project's license to avoid confusion.

The Guidelines should outline how contributors can participate, including how to fork the repository, create issues, submit pull requests, and any coding standards. I should make it welcoming and clear, encouraging contributions while setting expectations.

I'll structure both files with clear headings, using markdown syntax. I'll ensure the language is professional yet approachable, making it easy for new contributors to understand their roles.

I should also cross-reference the README and CONTRIBUTING files where appropriate, ensuring consistency in the project's documentation.

Let me draft each section step by step, starting with the README.

Wait, the user provided a previous response where the CONTRIBUTING.md started with "Contribution guidelines" and had a License section. I should follow that structure but perhaps expand on it to meet the user's requirements.

Hmm, I need to make sure both files are comprehensive and cover all necessary points without being too verbose. I'll aim for clarity and thoroughness, ensuring that anyone reading these files can understand how to contribute and use the project effectively.

I should also include additional sections if they add value, such as a Table of Contents in the README for easy navigation, or a section on how to report bugs in the CONTRIBUTING file.

Finally, I'll review both files to ensure they are well-organized, free of errors, and align with best practices for open-source projects.
